# Unique name for this workflow
name: Validate PR on develop branch

# Definition when the workflow should run
on:
    # The workflow will run whenever an event happens on a pull request
    pull_request:
      # The events are that a PR is opened, or when a commit is pushed
      # to a branch that has an existing pull request
      types: [opened, synchronize]
      # The branches filter allows to specify that this workflow should only
      # run if the branch name is "develop". This way we prevent this workflow
      # from running when PRs are opened on other branches
      branches: [ develop ]
      # We only care about changes to the force-app directory, which is the
      # root directory of the sfdx project. This prevents the job from running
      # when changing non-salesforce files (like this yml file).

        - 'force-app/**'

        # As mentioned in the blog post, this job runs inside a VM. Here we
        # can specify which OS this VM should run on.

        # of ubuntu

            # The idea is that the VM can access your remote repository
            # because your repository is an sfdx project.
            # This is a default action that allows us to enter the root 
            # directory of the repository

            # Make sure to specify fetch-depth:0. This allows us to
            # access previous commits that have been pushed to the repository.

            # We'll need this later when we try to figure out which metadata has 
            # changed between commits, so that we can only deploy that metadata
